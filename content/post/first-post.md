Well, I guess I have a new site/blog/thing. This is it. Since my last VPS provider died I haven't bothered moving Ghost over here, so now I'm using Hugo and I think it's a better choice. No NodeJS! No PHP! No .NET! Just pure HTML!

We'll see how this goes. Maybe I should, you know, actually publish the post... that'd be a good start.
