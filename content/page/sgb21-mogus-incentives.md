Incentives for demize for Among Us:

## Any donation above $10

Stop whatever I'm doing and eat a beanboozled bean.

## Donations directed towards demize

These donations must specifically mention me in the donation message, along with which one you want me to do. While
they will combine with the beanboozled incentive (so long as they're above $10), they will not combine with any other incentives.

    1. Stop doing tasks for one minute or until the next meeting (whichever comes first)
    2. Stop trying to kill people for one minute or until the next meeting (whichever comes first)
    3. Stop talking for a minute during the next meeting (or right away, if in a meeting)

    1. Stop doing tasks until the next meeting
    2. Stop trying to kill people until the next meeting
