I'm a security incident response analyst by day, and other things by night.

I don't use Arch Linux :)

Some other interesting points about me:

1. I'm a Twitch affiliate, with a sporadic stream schedule, mostly playing Mario Maker and Mario World romhacks.
2. I'm one of the mods of the Super Mario Making Showciety, a Twitch team for Mario Maker and SMW streamers. We do a yearly charity event, and our Discord can be a cool place to hang out.
3. I watch TV. Some of it is anime. You may have noticed from my avatars on social media.
5. I play video games sometimes. What kinds of video games? Video games.
11. I listen to a lot of music. My music tastes are pretty varied, but a few artists are important to me. I have Frank Turner and Enter Shikari tattoos. Madeon's Good Faith Forever show was the best thing I've ever experienced.
12. I run the unstable.systems Mastodon instance.
13. I wrote and maintain [Ghirahim_Bot](https://github.com/demize/ghirahim_rs), a link protection bot for Twitch chat. I also comaintain [fluid-queue](https://github.com/fluid-queue/fluid-queue), a self-hosted viewer levels bot for Twitch.

If you need to contact me, Mastodon is easiest ([@demize@unstable.systems](https://unstable.systems/@demize)), but other methods are listed on my [contact page]({{< relref "contact" >}}).
