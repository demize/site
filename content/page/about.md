As of the time of this writing, I am:

1. An infosec student
1. A Digital Evidence Recovery consultant
2. A security guard (licensed! because you need a license for that!) at my school's pub

These are in order of priority or time, since those work out roughly the same.

There's definitely more to me than that, though. This is much less ordered:

1. When I have the time, I provide ATC to people flying in flight sims in and around Toronto on [VATSIM](https://vatsim.net). As of the time of writing, I am an S2, which means I'm trained and qualified for DEL, GND, and TWR. If you don't know what that means, feel free to ask! If you think this is a strange hobby and I'm weird, you're probably right!
1. I run an IRC network at unstable.systems. It currently doesn't have a website. The MOTDs magically disappeared from the servers. I haven't bothered to fix either of these issues. If you want to join, irc.unstable.systems:+7777 works. There's also a hidden service running, DM me for the URL.
2. I run my own home network! Right now it's next to my bed. I have a PowerEdge T300 running Plex and associated services (also an abandoned, chopped down AD forest), an overly powerful computer running pfSense, and a D'Link rack-mount switch that's not mounted and I can't remember the model of. I'm using a Ubiquiti AP for wireless. Things change as I play around with it.
3. I watch TV. Some of it is anime. You may have noticed from my avatars on Twitter.
5. I play video games sometimes. I recently built an overly powerful gaming PC so I may play video games even more now. 
8. I don't do it nearly enough, but I enjoy reading. It can be hard for me to get into books sometimes, but I've found John Scalzi, Neal Stephenson, and Neil Gaiman to get my attention pretty easily. I'm always open to suggestions!
11. Most of the time I sit around on the bird website or the alien website and waste time. I should replace some of that with sitting around reading. I have literal piles of books to read.

If for some reason you need to get in touch with me, you can find me on Twitter. If for some ungodly reason you want to send me an *email* then you can find my PGP key on Keybase and email me. My email address is the same as the URL for this site if you were interpreting an SOA record.

## Other notes

The name of this site is a lyric from the Enter Shikari song *Redshift*. For some reason I feel like it's appropriate here?
